# AG Shop

Admin-first webshop platform (Livewire admin), with planned Vue-based front templates (desktop + mobile/PWA).

## Requirements

- PHP `8.4`
- Composer `2.x`
- Node.js `22.x` and npm
- MySQL/MariaDB

## Local Development Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
composer install
npm install
```

2. Create environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Configure `.env`:
- `APP_URL` (for Herd/local domain)
- `DB_CONNECTION=mysql`
- `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`

4. Generate app key:
```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

5. After `.env` DB credentials are valid and the target database already exists, run migrations:
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

6. Seed data:
```bash
php artisan db:seed
```
Expected prompt:
```text
Seed large dummy webshop dataset (100 categories, 1000 products, 3000 orders, 500 users, etc.)? (yes/no) [no]:
```
- Answer `no` for standard local baseline data.
- Answer `yes` when you need a large dummy dataset for performance/testing.
- You can also force this non-interactively with `SEED_DUMMY_DATA=true`.

7. Link storage:
```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

8. Build/start frontend assets:
```bash
npm run dev
```

9. Start app/runtime processes (if needed):
```bash
php artisan serve
php artisan queue:work
```

## Default Seeded Users (Non-Superadmin)

These are default local users for quick testing:

| Role | Email | Password |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Admin | `admin@agshop.local` | `admin` |
| Editor | `editor@agshop.local` | `editor` |
| Customer | `customer@agshop.local` | `customer` |

Super-admin users are intentionally not listed in this table.

## API Access Notes

- Wholesale API endpoints are under `/api/v1/wholesale`.
- API access is controlled per user (`api_access_enabled`) and via token abilities.
- CLI token creation:
```bash
php artisan wholesale:token user@example.com client-name
```

## Nabava.net XML feed

The outgoing product feed is available at `/feeds/nabava.xml` and is disabled until its environment-backed credentials are configured:

```dotenv
NABAVA_NET_FEED_ENABLED=true
NABAVA_NET_FEED_USERNAME=replace-with-feed-username
NABAVA_NET_FEED_PASSWORD=replace-with-feed-password
NABAVA_NET_FEED_LOCALE=hr
NABAVA_NET_STOREFRONT_URL=https://www.example.hr
```

Nabava.net can access it using `?username=...&password=...`. Keep the credentials in the server environment and never commit them to the repository.

## Useful Commands

```bash
php artisan optimize:clear
php artisan test
php artisan route:list
```
